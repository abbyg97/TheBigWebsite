# TheBigWebsite
  The project is to design a website for the Ole Miss Big Event which will have aspects that allow for volunteer registration, project registration, and easy search for specific aspects of the projects. The idea evolved from the need for the executive committee to have all information about the project and volunteers in one easily accessible place. Because of this need for consolidating information, all registration will be done on one site that has different views for different users. The project is on schedule to be completed by Thanksgiving in order to allow time for testing and final edits to be made before the final product is due.  In order to have this accomplished, all webpages have been created.  This is the first portion of the project MVPs because it provides the functionality to see all important information, perform necessary queries, import a CSV which is inserted into the database, and export tables to a CSV which can be opened as an Excel document.  The importing and exporting of an Excel presented problems but was solved by transitioning to using CSV files instead which can be easily converted.  I have also ran into problems with adjusting the css, but my sponsor helped me realize that this was simply because the cache needed to be cleared in Chrome.  The next step will be to create login abilities and restrictions on who can see which pages.  This should be accomplished in the next 2 weeks.
